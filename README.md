## Features

- Efficiently reduce multi-dimensional arrays.
- Supports strided operations for optimal performance.
- Simple API for easy integration.
- Built for Node.js and browser environments.
- Lightweight and easy to use.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-dispatch
```

## Usage

To use the constructor, first import the module:

```javascript
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-dispatch');
```

Next, create an ndarray and apply the reduction:

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const arr = ndarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

const result = reduce(arr, (a, b) => a + b);
console.log(result); // Outputs the reduced value
```

## API Documentation

### `reduce(arr, callback)`

- **arr**: The input ndarray.
- **callback**: A function that takes two arguments and returns a single value.

Returns the reduced value.

## Examples

### Example 1: Sum of Elements

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-dispatch');

const arr = ndarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
const sum = reduce(arr, (a, b) => a + b);
console.log(sum); // Outputs: 15
```

### Example 2: Maximum Value

```javascript
const ndarray = require('ndarray');
const reduce = require('ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-dispatch');

const arr = ndarray([1, 5, 3, 4, 2]);
const max = reduce(arr, (a, b) => (a > b ? a : b));
console.log(max); // Outputs: 5
```

## Additional Information

### Understanding ndarrays

An ndarray (N-dimensional array) is a powerful data structure that allows you to work with multi-dimensional data efficiently. It is commonly used in scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis. 

### Why Use Reduction?

Reduction operations are crucial when you need to condense data. They help summarize large datasets by aggregating values. For example, calculating the sum, average, or maximum of an array can provide insights into the data's overall characteristics.

### Performance Considerations

When working with large datasets, performance becomes critical. The `ndarray-base-unary-reduce-strided1d-dispatch` constructor is optimized for speed and efficiency. By using strided operations, it minimizes memory usage and enhances processing time.

### Use Cases

- **Data Analysis**: Summarize datasets by computing totals or averages.
- **Machine Learning**: Preprocess data by reducing dimensions.
- **Scientific Computing**: Perform calculations on large datasets efficiently.
